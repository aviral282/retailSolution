## Problem Statement
The HR  department needs to track employee work hours and in particular the break times the employee is entitled to. There are different employee positions and work times
All Employees are entitled to 
•	10mins break per hour worked
•	For every 4 hours they get an additional 10min break
Managers are entitled to
•	15mins break per hour worked
 Nightshift workers are entitled to
•	For every 2 hours they get an additional 10min break 

Produce a system in a language and technology of your choosing but preferably .NET. What the system should do:
•	Allow employee work hours to be entered
•	Display a report of the hours worked along with the break times they are entitled to
•	There is no need to have a Database
